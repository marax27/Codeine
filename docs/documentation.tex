\section{Glossary}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Agent - single application instance, is able to compute one subproblem at a time
    \item Computational problem - problem solvable with Codeine. It should be divisible into a finite amount of subproblems which can be solved independent of each other
    \item Computational network (usually referred to as "network") - a network of agents communicating with each other, who together solve one computational problem
    \item Subproblem - a single subproblem of the computational problem
\end{itemize}

\section{Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Project should implement peer-to-peer networking on LAN
    \item We should assume that about 5 agents at once can work on our computational problem
    \item Every agent should have exactly the same application
    \item After application launch, agent should automatically attempt to discover other agents in the network
    \item The computational problem itself doesn't matter, it should only allow for long enough computing time to let us see the network working as intended
    \item Subproblem assignment should be decentralized
    \item Agents should be immune to other agents disconnecting from the network, there should be no side effects
    \item Results should be visualized, accessible (in the best case in real time)
\end{itemize}

\section{Assumptions \& Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Packet type - a string consisting of only upper case letters (e.g. IMALIVE, NETTOPOLOGY)
    \item The solution of a single subproblem should be able to fit in a single UDP packet (\verb!<64kB!)
    \item Every subproblem has it's ID and immutable State, common for all subproblems
    \item Every subproblem can be solved
\end{itemize}

\section{Networking}
\subsection{Packets}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Topology discovery, registering agents
    \begin{itemize}
        \item IMALIVE - send empty packet informing that agent is in the network \verb!<>!
        \item NETTOPOLOGY - send network topology \verb!<agent[]>!
    \end{itemize}
    \item Subproblem assignment
    \begin{itemize}
        \item REGSUBPROB - register new subproblem \verb!<subproblem_id>!
        \item DROPSUBPROB - stop working on this subproblem \verb!<subproblem_id>!
    \end{itemize}
    \item Result distribution
    \begin{itemize}
        \item SUBPROBRES - send subproblem result \verb!<subproblem_id, subproblem_result>!
    \end{itemize}
    \item Confirmation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ACKNOWL - acknowledge \verb!<previous_package_control_sum>!
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rules}
\# - broadcast
\begin{itemize}
    \item \#{}IMALIVE $\rightarrow$ NETTOPOLOGY (optional)

\section{Computational problem}
The chosen problem is finding a hash created with SHA1 cipher corresponding to a hardcoded hash of a 6 letter password.
The goal is to find hashes for all possible 6 character combinations of lower case letters and digits and compare them to the hardcoded password until the correct one is found.
In the worst case scenario, $36^6$ hashes have to be calculated.

To solve it with a decentralized computing network, it has been split into $36^2$ subproblems,
each consisting of $36^4$ hashes to calculate. They are divided based on the first two characters,
e.g. one subproblem is to find hashes of all 6 character long strings that start with "bg".
Each agent can compute only one subproblem at a time.

\section{Project Structure}

\end{figure}

Packages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{app:} top-level package. It is the main thread of an application, responsible for managing other threads. It manages subproblem execution and communicates with the Broker. 
    The app package does not deal with network details directly: high-level commands are used instead of network packets.
    \item \textbf{messaging:} contains a Broker definition, an abstraction layer between the app and the computer network. 
    The Broker runs on a separate thread and listens to incoming packets, as well as sends commands received from the app package.
    \item \textbf{computing:} contains implementation details of computational problem.
    \item \textbf{shared:} contains utilities which are either used by all other packages, or are not unique to our project. 
    For instance, NetworkConnection could be easily used in other projects that utilise communication over network.
    \item \textbf{tests:} contains unit and integration tests that cover the rest of packages.
\end{itemize}

\section{Security}
The possibilities to disrupt a computational network are plentiful:
\begin{itemize}
    \item “Flood” the network with fake result packets
    \item Deny all “register subproblem” requests
    \item Solve subproblems using a “malformed” state (e.g. replacing an original texture while rendering an image)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Exchanging a state hash/control sum would help detect accidental mistakes. Malicious changes could be caught by solving a certain subproblem 
        several times (which still wouldn’t help if an attacker had control over nearly 50% of the network)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Disruption of data stored locally, in a file
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Little can we do to protect data against someone with a physical access to a machine
    \end{itemize}
    \item One computational network per actual computer network
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Introducing a kind of a session key might resolve the issue
    \end{itemize}
    \item Communication between agents is unencrypted
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Encryption itself will be easy to implement, if needed. It may be based on the aforementioned session key.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Technology}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Python 3.7:} Python version 3.7. introduced @dataclass, which makes it easier to work with data structures.
    It allows creating immutable data structures.
    \item \textbf{Network Communication:} transmission of data in JSON format, using UDP protocol.
    \item \textbf{Tkinter:} Python library Tkinter will be used to create GUI.
\end{itemize}
